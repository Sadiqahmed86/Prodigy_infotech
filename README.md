Internship at Prodigy Infotech
During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I worked on several projects where I applied my skills in data analysis and machine learning using Python within Jupyter Notebook. Below are the key tasks I completed:

1. Data Visualization and Analysis
Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
Created meaningful visualizations to present insights from data.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
3. Decision Tree Classification
Implemented decision tree algorithms for classification tasks.
Evaluated model performance and optimized hyperparameters.
4. Sentiment Analysis
Conducted sentiment analysis on textual data using NLP techniques.
Preprocessed text data and analyzed sentiment patterns.
5. Traffic Accident Analysis
Analyzed traffic accident data to identify contributing factors.
Presented findings and recommendations based on data analysis.
